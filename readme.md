# React-UI

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

### Setup

Install all dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, you can start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project will be served at http://localhost:3000.

Install all dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

## Development

For linting the source files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run lint

# or

npm run lint:fix
```

For running the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test

#or

npm run test:watch
```

## Docker Environment

If you want to get up and running without installing all special requirements of the project locally on your machine, you can follow these steps to set up a preconfigured Docker environment.

This environment has also the advantage, that it serves the application with a custom domain name and through HTTPS with valid SSL certificate.
