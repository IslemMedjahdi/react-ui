# Introduction

## Why React-UI

React UI is an opinionated component library based on React and Tailwind CSS. It makes development faster without compromising on style customization, responsiveness or accessibility.

React UI comes prebuilt with its own theme, but it's possible to override to customize the look to your preference (more in the theming section). To get a sense of what this library if capable of, take a look at our **Examples** section.

## Major Dependencies

Browser support: since React UI uses TailwindCSS v2, Internet Explorer is not supported.

### TailwindCSS

We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) throughout the project for the styling. Custom theming also require the use of Tailwind (read more in the theming section).

### Formik

We use [Formik](https://formik.org/) in all our forms components.

### ReachUI

To ensure good accessibility, some components are built on top of [ReachUI](https://reach.tech/) components.
